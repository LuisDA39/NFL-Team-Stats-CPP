<hr>

This repository contains a C++ program that simulates an NFL standings table. It tracks touchdowns, field goals, and points against for each team and provides a menu-driven interface for various operations. This project was developed as part of a university course on Analysis and Design of Algorithms to learn matrix operations, basic arrays, and related concepts.

## Features
- **Manual and Autofill**: Options to manually input or randomly generate team stats.
- **Matrix Display**: View the current standings of all teams.
- **Statistical Calculations**:
    - Average touchdowns scored across all teams.
    - Team with the most points calculated using a specific formula.
    - Team with the fewest points calculated similarly.
    - Average field goals per team.
    - Identification of the team with the most losses.
- **Vector Operations**: Display a vector of calculated points for each team.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for specific data points within the standings matrix.

## Usage
    1. Manual Fill: Enter stats manually for each team.
    2. Autofill: Automatically generate random stats for quick setup.
    3. Show Matrix: Display the current standings of all teams.
    4. Average Touchdowns: Calculate and display the average touchdowns scored.
    5. Team with Most Points: Identify and display the team with the most points.
    6. Team with Least Points: Identify and display the team with the least points.
    7. Average Field Goals: Calculate and display the average field goals per team.
    8. Team with Most Lost Games: Identify and display the team with the most losses.
    9. Show Points Vector: Display a vector showing calculated points for each team.
    10. Search: Search for a specific data point within the standings matrix.

## Implementation Details
- **Language**: C++
- **Matrix Dimensions**: 5 teams (rows) Ã— 3 stats (columns)

## Getting Started
To run the program:

- Compile the source code `main.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
- Execute the compiled program.
